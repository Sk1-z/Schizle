## README

Schizle is currently very early in development and official releases will not come for a while. When the official releases start to come, real installers will be setup. As of right now schizle is only avaible on windows and the interpreter can only be used within the same directory as the .ski file.

## About

Schizle is an _In-progress_ Lightweight scripting language with builtin support for compilation into executables written in 99% C with the objective of being simple and easy to learn.
